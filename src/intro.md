# Résumé

## Introduction

I am a Master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by Associate Professor Jianmin Ji.
My research interests include scenario-based autonomous vehicle safety assessment and KR-based traffic scenario representation and generation.
I'm interested in many robotics and autonomous driving fields, including reinforcement learning, motion planning, and trajectory optimization.
